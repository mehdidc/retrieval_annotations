This code can be used to create TorchVision compatible annotation files for Karpathy's splits of COCO, FLickr8k, and Flickr30k,
based on https://www.kaggle.com/shtvkumar/karpathy-splits.
You can use `build_splits.sh` to create the splits.
The resulting splits are availble in the [release](https://github.com/mehdidc/retrieval_annotations/releases/tag/1.0.0).
